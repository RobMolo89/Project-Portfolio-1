            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                We've all heard it before form an early age all the way through school, "Sit up straight. You'll get a
                bad back
                from slouching"
                Well, there's no evidence to support such claims. It just looks bad right? But you still have a soar
                back? or
                Neck, shoulder, upper back, headaches! Whats that all about?Thats what this site is for. Educating you
                as to the
                WHY behind your pain from prolonged sitting, even if you sit up straight all the time.
                Here's the answer, its simple. No matter what posture you sit in, slouched, upright, arms at a 90-degree
                angle
                to the keyboard with the monitor inline with your eyesight and all those things you were told by the
                enthusiastic person HR got in to give a talk on workplace ergonomics, it all doesn't matter because
                you’re not
                doing what the human body was designed for over 100's of thousands of years. MOVE!!

            <h2>Diaphragm</h2>
            <p>
                Movement is done with muscles and the muscle that moves the most throughout your life from your very
                first
                breath to your very last is your diaphragm. The breathing muscle. That’s what we’re going to move first.
                Our jobs can be stressful. Deadlines, bugs in code and time for passion projects as well as all of
                life’s stress
                adding up. When stress hits, historically, we’d move to respond. But you’re stuck. In a chair and must
                get work
                done. But that’s ok. We need to work to earn money to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.
                Lack of
                those things would be a lot more stressful!
                So stress spurs movement (Flight or fight). The first thing to move is the diaphragm. Breathing rate
                increasing
                is one of the first responses of being stressed. But we’re not going anywhere. These aren’t immediate
                threats to
                our physical health so lets take back control and breeeaaaaath. I.e. move the diaphragm through a
                smoother,
                deeper range of motion.
                Here’s a proven method to help bring the stress response back to baseline.

        <p>
            Once you’ve the hang of this it’s easily implemented whilst working away and you’ve taken the first
            step
            to
            controlling the stress response and mobilizing the body away from pain. And you didn’t even have to
            get
            up.

            <h2>Spine</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we’ve got the hardest working muscle in the body moving, let’s move what its attached to. The
                spine and
                the ribcage.
                Here’s an exercise that you can do from the comfort of your chair and get great relief from any lower
                back
                discomfort you may be having.
            </p>

            <p>
                Make sure to follow the cues closely and take your time.
                You should feel some resistance through your first few attempts but eventually, you’re body will adapt
                and
                you’ll be able to get into the position a lot smoother.
                One tip could be to put some books or a stack of printer paper on the floor to support your hands if you
                can’t
                get the whole way to the floor.

                Now that you’ve got the diaphragm moving and the spine and ribcage moving it’s time for the most
                important
                and
                possibly best piece of physical health advice you’ll ever hear.
                Get up and go for a walk. That’s it. Literally do what the human body is designed to do and that should
                keep
                you
                pain free in the most part.

                Pain is a multifactorial, highly complicated experience that is completely individualized and tied into
                not
                only
                our physical health, but our mental and social health too. What I’ve outlined above are preventative
                measures to
                try and stave off any pain related issues caused by long periods of sitting day and day out.
